# Joystick to keyboard tool

This tool converts *joystick* input into *keyboard* keystrokes. The
purpose is to add joystick support to programs and games that don't
support it.

What makes this tool different is that it supports combos: multiple
joystick buttons/axis are pressed in combination to produce different
strokes. For example, for roguelikes, pressing both down and left on
the D-pad could produce a `b` to indicate diagonal movement, rather
than producing both an `h` and a `j`.
